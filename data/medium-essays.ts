If you let AI write for you and think for you, of course this is the downside. Let’s do a similar test using AI and dynamic contemplation. Let’s also test neurodivergent people like myself who have completely integrated themselves into AI so that when we write essays, it is a reflection of our own complexity. The fact that there is an APA, MLA framework that exists ingrained into society means that you’re testing whether or not AI makes you less intelligent when aligning to that framework. I’d love for you to see pictures of my brain when I’m in gamma wave coherent state using AI because I’ve fully integrated my creative self into it. Thank you so much for this article so that I can build testing that completely contradicts these results and show that without proper integration into AI this is the price to pay.</p></div></div></section>\n",

Limited access to resources and financial knowledge can make it difficult to know where to begin. However, with the right mindset, resources, and approach, it is possible to break the cycle of poverty and become a successful investor. Here are some tips on how to become a savvy investor when you come from a poor family.</p><p name=\"ca60\" id=\"ca60\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I remember when my soldier of a single parent mom use to hand me the calculator at the grocery store….</p><p name=\"7802\" id=\"7802\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">“Honey we have $50 bucks to spend.

However, with the right mindset, resources, and approach, it is possible to break the cycle of poverty and become a successful investor. Here are some tips on how to become a savvy investor when you come from a poor family.</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"5374\" id=\"5374\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Educate Yourself</li></ol><p name=\"1a84\" id=\"1a84\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">One of the best ways to become a savvy investor is to educate yourself about investing. While a formal education in finance or economics may not be feasible for many, there are plenty of free resources available online, such as blogs, podcasts, and books, that can teach you the basics of investing. Consider starting with the classic book “The Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham, or look into courses and resources provided by investment platforms.</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"402e\" id=\"402e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Start Small</li></ol><p name=\"0d5c\" id=\"0d5c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Investing can be intimidating, especially if you’re just starting out with limited funds. However, the good news is that you don’t need a lot of money to start investing. In fact, many investment platforms allow you to start with as little as $1. By starting small, you can learn the ropes and develop a strategy without taking on too much risk.</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"138b\" id=\"138b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Diversify Your Portfolio</li></ol><p name=\"b0b2\" id=\"b0b2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Diversification is key to mitigating risk when it comes to investing. This means spreading your money across different types of investments, such as stocks, bonds, real estate and crypto. Diversification helps ensure that if one investment doesn’t perform well, your entire portfolio won’t suffer.</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"4459\" id=\"4459\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Use a Robo-Advisor</li></ol><p name=\"5864\" id=\"5864\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Robo-advisors are investment platforms that use algorithms to manage and optimize investment portfolios. These platforms are affordable and accessible, making them a great option for those who are just starting out with investing. By using a robo-advisor, you can benefit from the expertise of investment professionals without the high fees associated with traditional financial advisors. Wealth Simple was huge for me in the beginning. It made me feel like I was in the game but provided training wheels to keep me on track.</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"968c\" id=\"968c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Avoid High-Fee Investments</li></ol><p name=\"19c8\" id=\"19c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">When you’re just starting out with investing, it’s important to keep your costs low. This means avoiding high-fee investments, such as actively managed mutual funds, which can eat away at your returns over time. Instead, look for low-fee index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer exposure to a broad range of investments at a lower cost.</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"2d15\" id=\"2d15\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Stay Disciplined</li></ol><p name=\"7eb0\" id=\"7eb0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Investing is a long-term game, and success requires discipline and patience. It’s important to stick to your investment plan and resist the temptation to make emotional decisions based on short-term market movements. Remember, successful investing is about playing the long game and staying committed to your goals.</p><p name=\"110d\" id=\"110d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Contemplation: Becoming a savvy investor when you come from a poor family can be challenging, but it’s not impossible. By educating yourself, starting small, diversifying your portfolio, using a robo-advisor, avoiding high-fee investments, and staying disciplined, you can build a solid investment strategy that can help you achieve your financial goals over time.</p></div></div></section>\n",

The Los Angeles Angels’ two-way superstar has already made history by becoming the first player to be selected as both an All-Star pitcher and hitter in the same season. His incredible talent has generated much discussion about his potential earning power, with some speculating that he could become the first player to earn $50 million a year. But is this a realistic possibility?</p><p name=\"f9cf\" id=\"f9cf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To answer this question, we first need to understand how player salaries are determined in MLB. Unlike some other sports leagues, MLB does not have a salary cap. Instead, teams are subject to a luxury tax, which is a penalty that is imposed on teams that exceed a certain payroll threshold. This means that teams are free to offer whatever salary they like to their players, as long as they are willing to pay the luxury tax.</p><p name=\"c51a\" id=\"c51a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, in theory, there is no reason why Ohtani couldn’t become the first $50 million a year player. However, in practice, there are a number of factors that make this unlikely.</p><p name=\"11ad\" id=\"11ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First and foremost, Ohtani is still under contract with the Angels for the next two seasons. He signed a six-year, $25 million deal with the team in 2018, which means that he will earn an average of $4.1 million per year over the course of his contract. While this is certainly a very modest salary for a player of his caliber, it does give the Angels a certain degree of control over his future earnings. If Ohtani continues to perform at his current level over the next two seasons, the Angels will almost certainly look to sign him to a long-term extension. This would likely involve a significant increase in his salary, but it is unlikely that it would be enough to reach the $50 million mark.</p><p name=\"e3c6\" id=\"e3c6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Another factor to consider is the state of the current market for baseball players. While there are certainly players earning large salaries in MLB, the highest-paid players typically earn around $35 million a year. Currently, the highest-paid player in the league is Mike Trout, who signed a 12-year, $426.5 million extension with the Angels in 2019. This deal averages out to just over $35 million per year, which is still a long way short of the $50 million mark.</p><p name=\"f2fc\" id=\"f2fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is worth noting that there have been a number of factors that have contributed to the relatively stagnant market for baseball salaries in recent years. One of the most significant of these is the increasing use of advanced analytics in player evaluation. Teams are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to player acquisitions, which means that they are less likely to overpay for players who don’t offer sufficient value. Additionally, teams are becoming more cautious about committing to long-term contracts, as they are aware of the risks associated with giving large sums of money to players who may not perform as well in the future.</p><p name=\"aa23\" id=\"aa23\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Contemplation: While it is technically possible that Ohtani could become the first $50 million a year player, it is unlikely to happen anytime soon. The combination of his current contract, the state of the current market for baseball salaries, and the cautious approach of teams to player acquisitions all make it unlikely that he will achieve this milestone in the near future. However, it is clear that Ohtani is one of the most talented players in the league, and his continued success is sure to generate plenty of excitement among baseball fans for years to come.</p></div></div></section>\n",

These energies are not limited to men and women but rather are seen as universal principles that exist in everything. The concept of polarity can be found in various spiritual traditions, as well as in psychology, anthropology, and gender studies.</p><p name=\"e225\" id=\"e225\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Masculine Polarity The masculine polarity is often associated with qualities such as strength, action, and assertiveness. It is characterized by a focus on achieving goals, taking risks, and being independent. The masculine energy is often seen as dynamic and active, and is associated with the sun, fire, and the yang principle in traditional Chinese philosophy. In relationships, the masculine energy is often associated with the desire to protect, provide, and lead.</p><p name=\"f02b\" id=\"f02b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Feminine Polarity The feminine polarity is often associated with qualities such as nurturing, compassion, and intuition. It is characterized by a focus on relationships, emotions, and creativity. The feminine energy is often seen as receptive and passive, and is associated with the moon, water, and the yin principle in traditional Chinese philosophy. In relationships, the feminine energy is often associated with the desire to connect, nurture, and support.</p><p name=\"bca3\" id=\"bca3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Polarity in Relationships In romantic relationships, polarity is often seen as an important element in attraction and sexual chemistry. The idea is that when partners embody opposite energies, it creates a sense of tension and passion that can be very appealing. For example, a woman who embodies strong feminine energy may be attracted to a man who embodies strong masculine energy, and vice versa. The goal is to create a balance of energies that allows each partner to feel fulfilled and supported.</p><p name=\"1a19\" id=\"1a19\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Cultivating Polarity While polarity is often seen as a natural part of attraction, it can also be cultivated and developed in relationships. This can involve consciously embodying the energy that is opposite to your partner’s energy. For example, a man who is naturally more introverted and contemplative may need to cultivate more assertiveness and action in order to balance his partner’s feminine energy. Similarly, a woman who is naturally more nurturing and empathic may need to cultivate more independence and leadership in order to balance her partner’s masculine energy.</p><p name=\"bf47\" id=\"bf47\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">In conclusion, the concept of masculine and feminine polarity is a complex and multifaceted idea that has implications for relationships, gender, and spirituality. By understanding and cultivating these energies, we can create more fulfilling and harmonious relationships, as well as a deeper sense of connection with ourselves and the universe. While polarity is not limited to gender, it can provide a useful framework for exploring the different energies that exist within us and around us.</p></div></div></section>\n",
