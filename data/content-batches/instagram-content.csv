It's not just about shapes; it's about the relationships between them, mirroring the interconnectedness of everything. 

Think of the Fibonacci sequence found in nature – the spiral of a seashell, the branching of trees. These aren't random; they're expressions of a fundamental mathematical harmony. Exploring these patterns can unlock deeper insights into ourselves and our place in the cosmos. It can bring a sense of peace and knowing.

Our Genesis Collection translates these ancient principles into modern art, designed to resonate with your soul and transform your space into a sanctuary for reflection.

Think of the archetype of the 'Shadow' - the repressed aspects of our personality. Acknowledging and integrating the shadow is crucial for wholeness and self-acceptance.

Our art incorporates symbolic elements that resonate with Jungian archetypes, offering visual prompts for introspection and personal growth. Swipe to explore the symbolism in some of our pieces and see what resonates with you.

It’s present in the structure of sunflowers, seashells, and even the human face! When used in art, it provides a sense of balance and proportionality that our brains find naturally appealing.
