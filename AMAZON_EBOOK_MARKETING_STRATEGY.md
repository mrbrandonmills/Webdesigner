# 📚 AMAZON EBOOK MARKETING STRATEGY
## Turn Your 3 Books Into a Revenue Engine

**Last Updated:** November 15, 2025
**Goal:** $5,000/month ebook revenue by Month 3

---

## 📖 YOUR CURRENT SITUATION

**Books Published:**
- ✅ Block A (published on Amazon)
- ✅ Block B (published on Amazon)
- 📝 New Book (finishing this week)

**Current Sales:** $0/month (no marketing)
**Problem:** Great content, zero visibility

**Solution:** Strategic bundling + cross-promotion + traffic from photography site

---

## 🎯 THE TRIPLE-WIN STRATEGY

### Strategy Overview

Your photography e-commerce platform is about to drive traffic. Use that traffic to sell ebooks!

**3 Revenue Streams:**
1. **Photography products** (prints, canvas, apparel)
2. **Ebooks** (your 3 books)
3. **Affiliate marketing** (gear recommendations)

**Cross-Promotion Magic:**
- Photography buyers → Get free ebook sampler
- Ebook readers → Discover art prints
- Email list → Nurture both audiences

---

## 📦 BOOK PACKAGING STRATEGY

### Option 1: The Complete Collection Bundle

**Title:** "The Complete [Your Topic] Collection"
**Price:** $19.99
**Contents:**
- Block A (Full book)
- Block B (Full book)
- New Book (Full book)
- BONUS: Behind-the-scenes photo essay
- BONUS: Exclusive photography prints (digital)

**Why This Works:**
- Higher perceived value ($19.99 vs $2.99 x 3)
- One purchase decision instead of three
- Amazon algorithm loves bundles
- Better for KDP Select benefits

### Option 2: Trilogy Series

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Block A: $4.99 (entry point)
- Block B: $5.99 (middle)
- New Book: $6.99 (latest & greatest)
- Complete Bundle: $14.99 (save $3)

**Why This Works:**
- Price anchoring (bundle looks like a deal)
- "Also bought" recommendations kick in
- Readers start cheap, upgrade later

### Option 3: Free + Paid Funnel

**The Hook:**
- Block A: **FREE** (lead magnet)
- Block B: $5.99
- New Book: $7.99
- Photography Collection eBook: $9.99 (NEW - your photos + stories)

**Why This Works:**
- Free book builds email list
- Warm readers buy everything else
