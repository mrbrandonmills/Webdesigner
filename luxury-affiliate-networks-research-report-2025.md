## CONCLUSION

Based on comprehensive 2025 research, **CJ Affiliate, AWIN, and Rakuten Advertising** form the essential network trio for a luxury lifestyle platform targeting creative professionals aged 25-45 in the United States.

**Key Strategic Insights:**

1. **No Single Network Dominates** - Luxury lifestyle brands are distributed across networks based on category
2. **AWIN is Consolidating Power** - ShareASale absorption makes AWIN the largest network by program count
3. **Athleisure Brands Avoid Major Networks** - ALO Yoga, Athleta require FlexOffers; only Lululemon on AWIN
4. **Sustainable/Conscious Brands Cluster on AWIN** - Natural fit for Brandon Mills' conscious living content pillar
5. **Beauty is Split** - Rakuten for traditional (Sephora, Bluemercury), AWIN for luxury (YSL Beauty)
6. **High-AOV Art Programs Underserved** - Saatchi Art on CJ is primary option; Etsy on AWIN for volume

**Recommended Action:**
Register for CJ Affiliate, AWIN, and Rakuten Advertising immediately. These three networks provide 80%+ coverage of verified luxury lifestyle programs matching Brandon Mills' brand positioning and audience demographics.

**Programs NOT Available on Researched Networks:**
- Reformation (direct program via Skimlinks, 2.8%)
- ALO Yoga (FlexOffers, 13-15%)
