Elegance isn't what you wear.

It's how you inhabit it.

Tuxedo session with @amreedphoto — South of Los Angeles, August 2024.

When a photographer allows for intellectual exchange and creative exploration, the work becomes art. This is what collaboration looks like when ego steps aside.

## CAROUSEL POST 2: "Aqua Meditation Series"

**Images (in order):**
1. IMG_1205.jpg - THE HERO (reclined bench)
2. IMG_1196.jpg - Vulnerable moment
3. IMG_1207.jpg - Sculptural pose
4. IMG_1651.jpg - D&G window shot

**Caption:**
```
In a turquoise room, under natural light, something happens.

The camera captures vulnerability. Strength. The private moments before the public mask.

This is the work I love — where editorial meets art, where the body becomes sculpture, where performance reveals truth.

Grateful to work with @amreedphoto, a photographer who understands that great images require creative trust.

## CAROUSEL POST 3: "Black & White Masters"

**Images (in order):**
1. IMG_0280.jpg - Tuxedo B&W
2. IMG_1124.jpg - Fire extinguisher absurdist
3. IMG_1315.jpg - Window light contemplation
4. IMG_0738.jpg - Athletic Versace

**Caption:**
```
Black and white reveals what color conceals.

Four moments from a single session with @amreedphoto where we explored light, shadow, and the stories the body tells without words.

From tuxedo elegance to raw vulnerability, from absurdist humor (yes, that's a fire extinguisher) to quiet contemplation.

This is why I model — to explore the range of human expression through form.

Grateful for photographers like AM who create space for this kind of work.

Range.

Formal. Editorial. Character. Artistic. Commercial. Intimate.

Six images from one session with @amreedphoto showing what versatility looks like when a model and photographer truly collaborate.

This is my portfolio. This is what I bring to every shoot:
• Comfort across contexts (tuxedo to tank top)
• Authentic expression (not just poses)
• Creative partnership (not just direction-following)
• Professional range (formal to raw)

Agencies, brands, photographers: This is what I do. Let's create something exceptional together.

The magic happens when two creatives trust each other.

@amreedphoto doesn't just take photos — he creates space for exploration, welcomes intellectual exchange, and allows the work to unfold organically.

That's rare. That's why this session produced 158 images across formal, editorial, artistic, and character work.

This is what collaboration looks like.
