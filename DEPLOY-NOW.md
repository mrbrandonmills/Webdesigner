# 🚀 DEPLOY YOUR AUTONOMOUS SITE NOW

## ✅ Everything Is Built and Ready!

Your complete autonomous portfolio site is ready to deploy. Here's exactly what to do:

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Upgrade Webflow (REQUIRED - Do This First!)

**Go to:** https://webflow.com/dashboard

**Upgrade to:** **CMS Plan ($23/month)**

**Why CMS Plan?**
- ✅ Custom domain (brandonmills.com)
- ✅ 2,000 CMS items (you need 10 posts)
- ✅ Custom code embedding
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ API access (what I'm using)
- ✅ Room to grow

**⚠️ Without this upgrade, the import will fail** (free plan can't publish to custom domain)

---

### Step 2: Add Your Domain

1. In Webflow Dashboard → Site Settings → Hosting
2. Add custom domain: `brandonmills.com`
3. Follow Webflow's DNS setup instructions
4. Wait for DNS propagation (~5-60 minutes)

---

### Step 3: Promote Vercel Deployment

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find latest deployment (commit: "Build complete autonomous site importer")
3. Click **"Promote to Production"**
4. Wait ~2 minutes for build to complete

---

### Step 4: Import All 10 Posts

1. Navigate to: `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/admin/autonomous-import-all`
2. You'll see a beautiful dashboard showing:
   - **4 posts to enhance** (Good Company, Silver & Gold, Golden Touch, Top Shots)
   - **6 posts to generate** (City of Apples, Emphatic Design, etc.)
   - **145 total images** ready to import
3. Click **"🚀 Build Complete Site (10 Posts)"**
4. Watch the autonomous magic happen! ✨

**What happens:**
- Claude enhances descriptions with your brand voice
- Generates new content for Lorem ipsum posts
- Imports all 145 images from Squarespace
- Publishes everything to Webflow CMS
- Takes ~20-30 minutes total

---

### Step 5: Design Your Webflow Layout

**Option A: Use Webflow Designer (Visual)**
1. Go to Webflow Dashboard → Designer
2. Create pages:
   - Homepage (portfolio grid)
   - Portfolio template page (for CMS items)
   - About page
   - Contact page
3. Drag and drop to design
4. Bind CMS fields to your design
5. Publish!

**Option B: I Can Design It For You**
- Tell me the aesthetic you want
- I'll create custom HTML/CSS
- Upload to Webflow via API
- You review and publish

## 🎨 Recommended Design Style

Based on your brand voice (therapeutic warmth + renaissance sophistication):

### Homepage:
- Clean, minimal layout
- Large hero image or latest work
- Grid of portfolio posts (3 columns)
- Elegant typography
- Muted color palette (blacks, whites, grays with subtle accent)

### Portfolio Pages:
- Full-width hero image
- Title + date
- 300-500 word description (your AI-enhanced content)
- Image gallery below (masonry or grid layout)
- Next/Previous post navigation

## 💰 Webflow Cost Breakdown

**Monthly:**
