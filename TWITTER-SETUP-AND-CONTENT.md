## BRAUN IPL TWITTER THREAD - READY TO POST

### THREAD (Copy-Paste This Entire Thing)

**Tweet 1** (Opening):
```
I've been hairless since sixteen.

Not genetics—choice.

When the Braun IPL arrived, I committed to documenting honestly.

Here's my first week with at-home laser hair removal:

🧵 (7-part thread)
```

**Tweet 2** (Context):
```
1/ Why I tried it:

• Tired of daily shaving
• Salon laser costs $3k-5k
• Want permanent solution
• Braun IPL: $500, 400k flashes, 20+ year lifespan

Math checks out. But does it work?
```

**Tweet 3** (First Impressions):
```
2/ First Impressions:

The device feels premium. Weighted. German engineering.

SensoAdapt tech = auto-adjusts to skin tone
10 intensity levels
Glide mode for large areas

Not a toy. This is serious hardware.
```

**Tweet 4** (Day 1):
```
3/ Day 1 Treatment:

Started conservative—level 3 on arm.

Sensation? Warm pulse. Tiny rubber band snap + heat.

Not painful. Not pleasant. Just functional.

15 minutes for both arms. Ended on level 5.
```

**Tweet 5** (Day 3):
```
4/ Day 3:

Hair grows slower.

Usually by day 3: stubble.
This time: barely anything.

Regrowth pattern already patchy. Some areas completely bare.

This is working.
```

**Tweet 6** (Day 7):
```
5/ Day 7 Results:

Arm (first treated area): smooth, sparse regrowth
Legs: finer hair, almost invisible in high-intensity areas

It's not instant. But it's WORKING.

Exactly as advertised.
```

**Tweet 7** (The Surprise):
```
6/ The Surprise:

There's something meditative about IPL.

Deliberate. Methodical. Each pulse is a choice.

Self-curation. The same satisfaction as choosing the right book, the right espresso.

You're crafting your form, intentionally.
```

**Tweet 8** (Verdict + Link):
```
7/ Honest Verdict:

✓ Works as advertised
✓ Minimal discomfort
✓ Cost-effective vs salon
✗ Not instant results
✗ Doesn't work on dark skin or light hair

Full day-by-day breakdown + photos:
brandonmills.com/blog/braun-ipl…

Worth the $500? For me, absolutely.

## ADDITIONAL TWITTER CONTENT (Week 1-2)

### Tweet Ideas for Braun IPL Promotion:

**Teaser Tweet** (Before posting thread):
```
Spent the last week testing the Braun IPL (at-home laser hair removal).

Results surprised me.

Full breakdown coming tomorrow.

Questions? Drop them below. I'll answer honestly.
```

**Behind-the-Scenes**:
```
The Braun IPL has 400,000 flashes.

That's enough for full-body treatments for 20+ years.

Cost per flash: $0.00125

Salon laser per flash: $50-100

The economics are wild when you break it down.
```

**Comparison Tweet**:
```
Shaving: $5/month × 12 months × 30 years = $1,800
Waxing: $70/month × 12 months × 30 years = $25,200
Salon laser: $3,000-5,000 (6-8 sessions)
Braun IPL: $500 (one-time)

I did the math. You're welcome.
```

**Philosophical Tweet** (Brandon voice):
```
There's something about deliberate self-curation that feels... right.

Not vanity. Intentionality.

Like choosing the right notebook, the right espresso blend, the right morning routine.

Form follows function. Both should be cultivated.
```

**Update Tweet** (Week 2):
```
Braun IPL Week 2 update:

Regrowth is now 40-50% less than baseline.
Areas that I hit with level 8-9: almost nothing.
Lower intensity areas: some fine regrowth.

Conclusion: This actually works.

Full Week 2 breakdown: [link to future blog post]
```

**Engagement Tweet**:
```
For anyone considering at-home IPL:

What's holding you back?

• Cost?
• Skepticism it works?
• Not sure it's safe?
• Don't know if it'll work on your skin/hair type?

Ask me anything. I'll be honest.
```
