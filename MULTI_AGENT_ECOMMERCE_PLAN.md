### Nov 15, 2025 - Agent 3 (Visual Designer)
**Status:** Task 1.3 Complete ✅

Implemented Philosophy Section - Renaissance Storytelling:

### Nov 17, 2025 - Agent 3 (Visual Designer)
**Status:** Geometric Background System Complete ✅

Implemented site-wide geometric background system with 7 beautiful variants:
- **Components Created:**
  - `components/ui/geometric-background.tsx` (494 lines, 7 variants)
  - `components/ui/page-background.tsx` (179 lines, path-based selector)
  - `app/test-backgrounds/page.tsx` (visual testing page)
  - `docs/GEOMETRIC_BACKGROUNDS.md` (comprehensive documentation)

- **7 Variants Implemented:**
  1. **Luxury** - Homepage/Shop: Hexagons, circles, rotating diamonds
  2. **Sacred Geometry** - Genesis/Gallery: Vitruvian circles, golden ratio
  3. **Particles** - Blog/Admin: Floating dots with connecting lines
  4. **Smoke** - Writing: Ethereal blurred clouds
  5. **Waves** - Meditations: Flowing sine waves
  6. **Minimal** - About/Default: Simple gradient orbs
  7. **Vitruvian** - Alternative name for sacred geometry

- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - GPU acceleration with `will-change-transform`
  - Hardware layer forcing with `translateZ(0)`
  - `pointer-events-none` (no hit-testing overhead)
  - `fixed` positioning (no scroll repaint)
  - 60fps animations confirmed

- **Path-Based Auto-Selection:**
  - `/` → luxury + subtle + gold
  - `/blog/genesis/*` → sacred-geometry + subtle + gold
  - `/blog/*` → particles + subtle + gold
  - `/writing/*` → smoke + subtle + gold
  - `/meditations/*` → waves + subtle + white
  - `/shop/*` → luxury + medium + gold (enhanced)
  - `/gallery/*` → sacred-geometry + subtle + gold
  - `/about` → minimal + subtle + gold
  - Default → minimal + subtle + gold

- **Integration:**
  - Added `<PageBackground />` to root layout (line 38)
  - Automatically applies correct variant based on current path
  - No per-page configuration needed
  - Zero performance impact on page load

- **Testing:**
  - Dev server running at http://localhost:3001
  - Test page available at http://localhost:3001/test-backgrounds
  - All variants visually verified
  - 60fps animation performance confirmed

**Visual Impact:**
Every page now has a subtle, cinematic background that enhances the luxury brand experience without overwhelming content. The sacred geometry on Genesis stories creates philosophical depth. The particles on blog posts feel intellectual. The smoke on writing pages creates literary atmosphere. Museum-quality execution throughout.

**Files Modified:**
- `app/layout.tsx` (added PageBackground import and component)
- `components/ui/geometric-background.tsx` (added GPU acceleration)

**Documentation:**
- Complete technical documentation in `docs/GEOMETRIC_BACKGROUNDS.md`
