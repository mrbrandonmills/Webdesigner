## Integration of Andrew Gerard "The Rebirth"

The Andrew Gerard collaboration has been successfully integrated into the Genesis archive as a special featured story. This pivotal post-cancer photoshoot represents the transformative moment when Brandon began reclaiming his identity and career.

**Integration Details:**
- Featured prominently in Genesis page with dedicated "The Rebirth" section
- Positioned between hero section and photo gallery
- Includes full story about cancer recovery and artistic rebirth
- Links to Andrew Gerard's Instagram (@andrewgerardphotography)
- Maintains the powerful "droplets of mercury coalescing" narrative
- Preserves the emotional depth of this career-defining collaboration

---

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure Changes
```
/public/images/gallery/genesis/
├── runway/
│   └── B.25.jpg (moved from editorial/)
├── editorial/
│   └── [27 photos]
└── campaigns/
    └── [22 photos]
```

### Code Updates
1. Updated TypeScript interface to include 'runway' category
2. Added runway photo entry with new story
3. Implemented 3-tab navigation system (All, Runway, Editorial, Campaigns)
4. Added "The Rebirth" featured section to Genesis page
5. Updated gallery navigation to redirect Andrew Gerard to Genesis
6. Updated hero description to mention "transformation and rebirth"

---

## Summary Statistics

| Category | Photo Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Runway | 1 | 2% |
| Editorial | 27 | 54% |
| Campaigns | 22 | 44% |
| **TOTAL** | **50** | **100%** |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Runway Category Growth:** Currently only 1 runway photo identified. Consider seeking additional runway photography from early career to expand this category.

2. **Andrew Gerard Photos:** The 3 Andrew Gerard photos from the Vancouver collaboration could be added to the Genesis gallery as a special subsection to visually represent "The Rebirth" story.

3. **Brand Attribution:** Consider adding brand names to more campaign photos where identifiable to enhance storytelling.

4. **Chronological Ordering:** Photos could be reordered chronologically within each category to show career progression.

5. **Story Enhancement:** Some campaign photos have generic stories that could be enhanced with more specific brand or location details.

---

## Conclusion

The Genesis gallery reorganization successfully categorizes 50 photos into meaningful groups while integrating the powerful Andrew Gerard rebirth narrative. The new 3-category system (Runway, Editorial, Campaigns) provides clear organization while the featured "Rebirth" section adds emotional depth and context to Brandon's journey from cancer survivor to thriving model and entrepreneur.

The visual analysis revealed a portfolio heavily weighted toward editorial work (54%), with strong commercial campaign experience (44%), and limited but powerful runway representation (2%). This distribution reflects a modeling career focused on artistic editorial storytelling and successful brand partnerships.
