## EXAMPLES OF GOOD WORK:

### Good Product Recommendation:
```markdown
## Product: "The Renaissance Portfolio" - Digital Course

**What it is:**
12-week online course teaching creative professionals how to build multifaceted careers (modeling + acting + research + AI engineering).

**Target Customer:**
- Age: 25-40
- Occupation: Creative professionals feeling pigeonholed
- Problem: Want to diversify income streams but don't know how
- Income: $40k-100k/year

**Price Point:** $497 one-time or $97/month for 6 months

**Why it fits Brandon:**
- Showcases his unique multifaceted approach
- Leverages his actual experience (not theoretical)
- High perceived value (transformation vs information)
- Scalable (digital delivery)
- Aligns with "therapeutic warmth + renaissance sophistication"

**Revenue Potential:**
- 10 students/month = $4,970/month
- 100 students/month = $49,700/month

**Effort to Create:** Medium (2-3 weeks to film and edit)

**Launch Sequence:** Phase 2 (after simpler products validate audience)
```

### Bad Product Recommendation:
```markdown
## Product: Generic Photography Presets

**What it is:** Lightroom presets

**Price:** $29

**Why:** Other photographers sell these
```
❌ This is bad because:
- No unique positioning
- Doesn't leverage Brandon's multifaceted identity
- Low value, commodity product
- No clear target customer
- Weak revenue potential
