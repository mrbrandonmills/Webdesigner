### Sample Captions (GPT-4 will generate similar)

**Example 1 - Product Drop:**
```
spent all week getting this print just right ✨

the color balance on this one was tricky. wanted that
golden hour glow without it looking too warm

thoughts? should i do a matte or glossy finish
```

**Example 2 - Behind the Scenes:**
```
studio update: finally got the new printer set up

these colors are coming out insane. way better than
the old setup

anyone else obsess over print quality or just me
```

**Example 3 - Design Process:**
```
starting with a sketch vs jumping straight to digital

which works better? genuinely curious how other
designers approach this

drop a comment 👇

- Double the pins = double the traffic
