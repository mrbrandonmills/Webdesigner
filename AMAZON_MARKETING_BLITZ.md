   TITLE: Random Acts of Self-Actualization: Building a Non-Addictive Life

   SUBTITLE: From NASA Engineer to Philosopher: A Journey of Breaking Free and Finding Authentic Self

   DESCRIPTION:

   Breaking Free from Society's Addictive Patterns

   What happens when a NASA engineer walks away from everything to pursue authentic self-actualization? In this raw, vulnerable memoir, Brandon Mills shares his journey from the corridors of NASA to the depths of self-discovery, breaking free from society's most seductive addictions along the way.

   In "Random Acts of Self-Actualization," you'll discover:

   ✓ How to identify and break free from subtle addictive patterns in your life
   ✓ The philosophy of unconditional love and radical acceptance
   ✓ Practical meditation and mindfulness techniques from someone who needed them most
   ✓ What it really means to live authentically vs. living for others' expectations
   ✓ How a polymath approach to life creates deeper meaning and fulfillment
   ✓ The intersection of Eastern philosophy, Western psychology, and personal transformation

   From learning unconditional love after heartbreak, to understanding mental health through lived experience, to combining ancient wisdom with modern neuroscience - this book is a roadmap for anyone tired of living on autopilot.

   Perfect for readers who loved:
   - "Atomic Habits" by James Clear
   - "The Untethered Soul" by Michael Singer
   - "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius
   - "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle

   If you're ready to break free from the addictive patterns holding you back and step into radical self-actualization, scroll up and click "Buy Now."

   Your transformation begins with one random act of courage.
