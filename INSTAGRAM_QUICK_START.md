**Example Captions:**
```
spent all week getting this print just right ✨

the color balance on this one was tricky. wanted that
golden hour glow without it looking too warm

thoughts? should i do a matte or glossy finish
```

```
studio update: finally got the new printer set up

these colors are coming out insane. way better than
the old setup

anyone else obsess over print quality or just me
```
