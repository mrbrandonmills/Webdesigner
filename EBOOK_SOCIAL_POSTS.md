POST 13:
5 subtle addictions society normalizes:

1. Constant productivity
2. External validation
3. Comparison to others
4. Comfort-seeking
5. Emotional numbing

I wrote a whole book about breaking free from these patterns.

Check it out: [LINK]

POST 14:
NASA taught me to think systematically.

Philosophy taught me to think deeply.

Meditation taught me to think clearly.

The intersection of all three?

That's where self-actualization happens.

My book explores this: [LINK]

POST 15:

The difference between self-improvement and self-actualization:

Self-improvement = Becoming a better version of what others want
Self-actualization = Becoming who you authentically are

My book is about the latter: [LINK]

POST 17:
