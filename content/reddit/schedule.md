### General Reddit Timing Principles

1. **The 2-Hour Window**: Post 2 hours before peak traffic. Posts need time to gain initial upvotes before the crowd arrives.

2. **Time Zones**: Reddit is heavily US-centric. EST/PST are primary. 6-8 AM EST catches early East Coast plus late night West Coast.

3. **The Monday Effect**: Many subreddits spike on Monday (new week energy). But competition is also higher.

4. **Sunday Evenings**: Often overlooked but high-engagement. People are winding down and browsing.

## Account Strategy

### Building Karma Before Posting

**Phase 1: Lurk (Week 1)**
- Read top posts in target subreddits
- Understand community norms and what gets upvoted
- Note writing styles that succeed

**Phase 2: Comment (Weeks 2-4)**
- Comment helpfully on new posts
- Answer questions in your areas of expertise
- Add value to discussions
- Avoid commenting just to comment
- Target: 100-200 karma

**Phase 3: Small Posts (Weeks 4-6)**
- Post questions to generate discussion
- Share shorter insights
- Engage heavily with all comments
- Target: 300-500 karma

**Phase 4: Value Posts (Week 6+)**
- Post your prepared content
- Continue engaging in comments
- One post per subreddit per month maximum

### Account Health

**Do:**
- Maintain 10:1 comment-to-post ratio
- Comment on others' posts in the same subreddits
- Respond to all comments on your posts
- Be genuinely helpful beyond self-interest
- Use separate accounts for different niches (optional but safer)

**Don't:**
- Post to multiple subreddits simultaneously
- Only show up to post your content
- Ignore comments or be defensive
- Use new accounts for promotional content
- Cross-post the same content to multiple subreddits

---

## Avoiding Bans

### Red Flags That Get You Banned

1. **Astroturfing patterns**: Multiple similar posts across subreddits
2. **Karma farming**: Low-effort comments/posts just to build karma
3. **Spam behavior**: Same link in multiple places
4. **Vote manipulation**: Asking for upvotes, using alt accounts
5. **Defensive reactions**: Arguing with users who question your motives

### Safe Practices

**Content:**
- Every post must stand alone as valuable without the link
- Mention tool only once, at the end
- Frame as "I found this helpful" not "try my thing"
- Never lie about affiliation (if asked, be honest)
- Write differently for each subreddit - not copy/paste

**Links:**
- No URL shorteners (major red flag)
- Don't link to landing pages with popups
- Ensure site looks legitimate
- Only link to free tools/resources
- Consider skipping the link entirely and putting it in your profile

**Behavior:**
- If called out, don't argue. Apologize if appropriate and move on
- Delete posts that get heavily downvoted
- Take breaks between promotional posts (2+ weeks)
- Be active in other discussions, not just your posts

**Account:**
- Age your account before posting promotional content
- Have genuine activity history
- Different writing style than marketing copy
- Use a consistent persona

## Tracking and Optimization

### Metrics to Track

**Per Post:**
- Upvote ratio
- Comment count
- Upvote total
- Time to first upvote
- Traffic to site (UTM parameters)

**Per Account:**
- Overall karma trajectory
- Comment karma vs post karma
- Any mod warnings or removals

### UTM Parameters

Add these to your links to track Reddit traffic:
```
brandonmills.com/dream-decoder?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=rdreams_post1
```

Helps you understand which posts drive actual traffic.

### Testing

- Test different post titles (same content, different subreddits)
- Test different times
- Test with/without links
- Track which angle gets most engagement

## Response Templates

### If Called Out as Promotional

**Apologetic approach:**
"You're right, I should have been more transparent that I use this tool regularly and have recommended it before. I genuinely find it helpful for [specific thing], but I understand if that comes across as self-promotional. Happy to remove the link if mods prefer."

**Never say:**
- "It's not promotional"
- "I'm just trying to help"
- "Why are you so suspicious"

### For Genuine Questions About the Tool

"It's a free AI tool that applies Jungian dream analysis. I've found it useful for [specific benefit]. Happy to answer questions about how I use it."

### Engaging with Good Comments

- Ask follow-up questions
- Share additional relevant information
- Thank people for their insights
- Avoid one-word responses

---

## Risk Management

### Low-Risk Approach
- Never include links in post body
- Mention "I use a tool I found online"
- Put actual link only in your profile
- Users who want it can find it

### Medium-Risk Approach (Recommended)
- Include link at end of genuinely valuable post
- One post per subreddit per month maximum
- Heavy engagement beyond your own posts
- Honest if directly asked about affiliation

### High-Risk (Avoid)
- Multiple posts per week
- Same content across subreddits
- New accounts
- Defensive when questioned
- Links without substantial content
