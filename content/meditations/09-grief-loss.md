## Script

Welcome, dear soul. I am honored to sit with you in this tender space of grief. Whether your loss is recent or from long ago, whether it is the loss of a person, a relationship, a dream, or a version of yourself... all grief is valid. All grief deserves to be honored.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Find a position that feels safe and supported. You may wish to wrap yourself in a blanket, hold a cushion, or simply place your hands over your heart. Whatever brings you comfort.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Close your eyes gently. Take a slow, deep breath in... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and a long breath out.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

With your next breath, breathe in compassion for yourself... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and breathe out, knowing you are held in this moment.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

One more breath, breathing in courage... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and breathing out, making space for what needs to be felt.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Grief is not a problem to be solved. It is not a weakness to be overcome. It is love with nowhere to go. It is the price we pay for having loved, for having cared, for having invested our heart in someone or something.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

In this practice, we will not try to fix your grief or rush through it. We will simply be with it. We will honor it. And perhaps, we will begin to integrate it into the larger story of your life.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Begin by bringing your awareness to your breath. Notice the inhale... the exhale... the natural pause between. Your breath continues, even in grief. Life continues, even in loss.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Now, gently, when you feel ready, bring to mind what or who you have lost. You don't need to dive into the pain all at once. Just touch it lightly, like dipping your toe into water.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Notice where you feel the grief in your body. Is it in your chest, heavy and tight? In your throat, choking back words? In your belly, like a hollow ache? Simply notice, without judgment.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Place one or both hands on this area of your body where the grief lives. This is you, offering comfort to yourself. Feel the warmth of your own hand, your own presence.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Say to yourself, silently or aloud: "This grief is here because I loved. This pain is proof that something mattered deeply to me."

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Grief is not the enemy. It is the teacher. It shows us what we value, what we hold sacred, what makes life meaningful.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Take a moment now to honor what or who you lost. If it was a person, remember them not just as you lost them, but as they lived. Their laugh, their quirks, the way they made you feel.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

If it was a relationship, remember the good parts too, not just the pain of its ending. What did it teach you? How did it help you grow?

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

If it was a dream or a version of yourself, acknowledge what it represented. What were you hoping for? That hope was real and valid.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Now, I invite you to speak to this person, dream, or lost part of yourself. Speak in your heart or in a whisper. Tell them what you need to say. Perhaps it's "thank you." Perhaps it's "I'm sorry." Perhaps it's "I miss you." Perhaps it's "I'm angry."

*[Pause 15 seconds]*

Whatever needs to be said, say it now. There is no wrong thing to feel. All of it is welcome here.

*[Pause 15 seconds]*

If tears come, let them flow. Tears are not a sign of weakness. They are prayers. They are the heart's way of releasing what cannot be held inside anymore.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Breathe into your grief. Breathe into the ache. Sometimes the only way through is through.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

And now, I want to offer you a truth that may be hard to hear right now, but one day you will understand: this loss will transform you. Not today, perhaps not for a long time, but eventually.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Grief cracks us open. And yes, that breaking is painful. But through those cracks, light can enter. Compassion can grow. Wisdom can emerge.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

You will not be the same person you were before this loss. And that's not a bad thing. You will be deeper. More tender. More aware of what truly matters.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

The Buddhist teacher Pema Chödrön says that "only to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible be found in us."

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

There is something in you that cannot be destroyed, even by this loss. A core, a light, an essence that remains.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Let's connect with that now. Imagine that beneath the grief, beneath the pain, there is still a small flame burning in your heart. This is your life force, your will to continue, your capacity to eventually heal.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

It may be a tiny flame right now. That's okay. It doesn't need to be a roaring fire. It just needs to keep burning.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

With each breath, you feed this flame. Not to bypass your grief, but to give you strength to carry it.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Breathe in... the flame grows slightly brighter. *[Pause 4 seconds]* Breathe out... the grief is still there, and that's okay.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Breathe in... resilience. *[Pause 4 seconds]* Breathe out... sorrow.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Both can exist at the same time. You can grieve and still want to live. You can miss what was and still move forward.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Before we close, I invite you to make one small gesture of integration. This is a way of saying, "I will carry this grief with me, but I will not let it be the only thing I carry."

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Place both hands over your heart. Feel your heartbeat. This heart that loved, that lost, that grieves... it still beats. It still has capacity for joy, for connection, for meaning.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Say to yourself: "I honor what I have lost. I honor my grief. And I honor my own resilience. I will carry this love forward."

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Take a moment to thank yourself for showing up today, for having the courage to feel, to remember, to grieve. That takes strength.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Take three more deep breaths. Each one a reminder that you are still here, still breathing, still alive.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

When you are ready, and there is no rush, begin to bring your awareness back to the room. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Notice the sounds around you.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Place your hands on the ground or on your legs. Feel the solid earth beneath you, supporting you.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Gently open your eyes.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Moving through grief is not a linear path. There will be waves. Some days will be harder than others. That's normal. That's part of being human.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Be patient with yourself. Be gentle. And know that you are not alone in this.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

May you be held in your grief. May you find moments of peace. May you, in time, integrate this loss into a larger story of a life fully lived.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

May you be blessed.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Namaste.
