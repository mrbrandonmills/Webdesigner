## Script

Welcome, dear friend. I honor you for being here today, especially if you are experiencing pain. This practice is not about making pain disappear, but about changing your relationship with it, and inviting the body's natural healing wisdom to emerge.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Find the most comfortable position you can. Whether lying down, seated with support, or even standing if that feels better. Use pillows, cushions, whatever you need. There is no right way to do this.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Close your eyes gently, or keep them softly open with a downward gaze. Take a moment to settle in.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Begin with three deep breaths, breathing in whatever you need right now... perhaps relief, perhaps courage, perhaps simply presence. And breathing out, letting go of resistance, letting go of frustration.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Breathe in compassion... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...breathe out struggle.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Again, breathing in acceptance... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...breathing out the fight.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

One of the paradoxes of pain is that when we resist it, it intensifies. When we can meet it with gentle awareness instead of fear, something shifts. We're going to practice that now.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Allow your breath to settle into its natural rhythm. Notice where you feel the breath most easily. Perhaps in your belly, your chest, or the passage of air through your nostrils.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Your breath is your companion through this practice. Whenever the pain feels too intense, you can always return to the simple sensation of breathing.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Now, bring your awareness to the top of your head. The crown, the scalp. Simply notice what's here without judgment. Is there tension? Heaviness? Or perhaps ease?

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

With your next exhale, imagine breathing directly into this area, sending a wave of relaxation, of kindness.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Move your awareness down to your face. Your forehead, your eyes, your jaw. If there's tightness here, see if you can soften it, even just a fraction. If not, simply acknowledge it: "I see you, tension. You are trying to help me."

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Bring your awareness to your neck and throat. This bridge between head and body often holds much. Notice what's present. Breathe into this space with gentleness.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Now to your shoulders. So often we armor ourselves here. If there's pain or tightness, rather than trying to push it away, can you turn toward it with curiosity? What is this sensation, exactly? Is it sharp or dull? Constant or pulsing? Hot or cold?

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

When we investigate pain with interest rather than fear, we often find it's not one solid thing, but a changing landscape of sensations.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Move your awareness down your arms, from shoulders to fingertips. Notice the quality of sensation in your upper arms, your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, your hands.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

If there is pain anywhere in your arms, imagine breathing healing light directly to that spot. Not to fix it, but to acknowledge it, to care for it.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Bring your awareness to your chest and upper back. Your heart space. This is where we sometimes hold emotional pain as physical sensation. Whatever you find here, breathe into it with deep compassion.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Say silently to any pain you find: "I am listening. I am here with you. You are not alone."

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Notice your mid-back, your lower back. For many, this is where pain lives. If this is true for you, I want you to try something. Instead of bracing against the pain, see if you can let your awareness rest gently on it, the way sunlight rests on water.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

You're not trying to change it. You're simply being with it. Present. Compassionate. This is the beginning of healing.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Bring awareness to your belly, your abdomen. Breathe deeply into this space. This is where we digest not just food, but also our experiences, our emotions. Send kindness here.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Notice your hips, your pelvis. This area often holds chronic pain for many people. If you're one of them, I want you to know that your body is not betraying you. It is communicating with you in the only language it knows.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Can you listen without judgment? Can you soften around the pain instead of tightening against it?

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Move your awareness down your legs. Your thighs, noticing the quality of sensation. Your knees, which bear so much weight. Breathe into your knees with gratitude for all they do.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Your calves, your shins. Your ankles, your feet. Notice each area. If there is pain, acknowledge it. If there is ease, appreciate it.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Now, rather than focusing on specific body parts, I invite you to sense your body as a whole. One complete system, doing its best to maintain balance and heal.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Notice where in your body you feel the most intensity or discomfort right now. Don't judge it. Just notice.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Direct your breath to this area. Imagine that with each inhale, you're sending healing oxygen, warmth, light to this part of you. With each exhale, you're releasing tension, inflammation, the pain itself.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Breathe in healing... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...breathe out pain.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Breathe in compassion... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...breathe out suffering.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Continue breathing this way, at your own pace.

*[Pause 12 seconds]*

I want to remind you of something important: healing is not always about the complete absence of pain. Sometimes healing means learning to live with more peace despite the pain. It means not letting pain define your entire existence.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Even if your body is in pain, you can still find moments of joy, of connection, of beauty. You are more than your pain.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Place one or both hands on the area of your body that hurts most, if you can reach it. Feel the warmth of your own touch. This is you, caring for you.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Say these words to your body, either silently or aloud: "Thank you for working so hard. I'm sorry you're hurting. I'm listening. I'm here. We're going to get through this together."

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Your body is not your enemy. It is your oldest friend, your most faithful companion. It has been with you since the beginning and will be with you until the end. Treat it with the kindness it deserves.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Now, expand your awareness one more time to your whole body. Notice if anything has shifted. Perhaps the pain is exactly the same. That's okay. Or perhaps it's softened a little. Perhaps your relationship to it has changed, even slightly.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Take three more deep, nourishing breaths. Each one a gift to your body.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

When you're ready, begin to gently move. Wiggle fingers and toes. Stretch in whatever way feels good. Move slowly, with care.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

If your eyes are closed, open them gently.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Thank you for this practice. Thank you for choosing awareness over avoidance, compassion over resistance.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

May you know healing. May you know peace. May you be held in compassion.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Namaste.
