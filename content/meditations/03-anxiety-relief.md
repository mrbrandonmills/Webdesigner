## Script

Hello, and welcome. I'm so glad you're here. If you're feeling anxious right now, please know that you're not alone, and that this feeling, like all feelings, is temporary.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Let's begin by finding a comfortable position. You can sit or lie down, whichever feels most supportive right now. Place one hand on your heart and one hand on your belly.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Feel the warmth of your own hands. This simple touch is a signal to your nervous system that you are safe.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Now, without trying to change anything, just notice your breath. Where do you feel it? Perhaps in your chest, your belly, your throat. Simply observe.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Anxiety often makes our breath shallow and quick. That's okay. There's nothing wrong with you. Your body is trying to protect you. Let's gently help it understand that right now, in this moment, you are safe.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

I'm going to guide you through a calming breath pattern. We'll breathe in for four counts, hold for four counts, and out for six counts. The longer exhale activates your rest and digest response.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Let's try it together. Breathe in... two, three, four. *[Pause 4 seconds]* Hold... two, three, four. *[Pause 4 seconds]* Breathe out... two, three, four, five, six.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Beautiful. Let's do that again. In... two, three, four. *[Pause 4 seconds]* Hold... two, three, four. *[Pause 4 seconds]* Out... two, three, four, five, six.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

One more time, and then we'll return to natural breathing. In... two, three, four. *[Pause 4 seconds]* Hold... two, three, four. *[Pause 4 seconds]* Out... two, three, four, five, six.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Lovely. Now let your breath return to its natural rhythm. Notice if it feels a bit slower, a bit deeper.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Anxiety lives in our thoughts about the future or our stories about the past. But right here, right now, in this present moment, you are okay. Let's anchor ourselves here.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

I'm going to guide you through a grounding exercise. Notice five things you can see around you. Don't say them aloud, just notice them quietly. The corner of the room, a spot of light, the texture of fabric, anything at all.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Now, four things you can physically feel. The chair beneath you, your clothes against your skin, the air on your face, the weight of your hands.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Three things you can hear. Perhaps my voice, sounds from outside, the hum of electricity, your own breath.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Two things you can smell. Even if it's very subtle... the scent of the room, your own skin, fresh air.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

And one thing you can taste. Perhaps the lingering taste of tea, or simply the taste of your own mouth.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

You've just arrived fully in the present moment. This is where your power lives. Anxiety cannot survive in the now.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Place both hands on your heart now. Feel your heartbeat. This beautiful, faithful heart that has been beating for you since before you were born. It knows how to regulate itself.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Say these words silently or aloud: "I am safe. I am here. This moment is enough."

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

"I am safe. I am here. This moment is enough."

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Let's return to the breath. This time, imagine that with each inhale, you're breathing in calm, cool, blue light. With each exhale, you're releasing anxious energy as gray smoke.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Breathing in calm, blue light... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...breathing out gray smoke.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Breathing in peace... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...breathing out worry.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

With each breath, you're choosing calm over chaos. You're choosing presence over panic.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Remember, you don't need to fight anxiety or push it away. Simply acknowledge it: "I see you, anxiety. Thank you for trying to protect me. But right now, I'm okay." Then gently return your attention to your breath.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Your breath is always with you. It's an anchor you can return to anytime you feel yourself drifting into anxious thoughts. Just three conscious breaths can shift your entire state.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Let's take three more deep breaths together. Breathing in fully... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and out completely.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Again, in... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and out.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

One more. Breathing in peace and presence... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and releasing all that no longer serves you.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

When you're ready, begin to gently move your fingers and toes. Blink your eyes open if they were closed.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

You are here. You are present. You are safe.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Carry this feeling of groundedness with you. Remember, you can return to this practice anytime you need it. Your breath is always here, ready to guide you home to calm.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Thank you for taking this time for yourself. You are stronger than you know.
