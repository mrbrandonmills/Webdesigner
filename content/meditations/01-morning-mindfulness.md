## Script

Welcome to this morning mindfulness practice. Find a comfortable seated position, whether that's on the edge of your bed, in a chair, or on a cushion on the floor. Allow your spine to be tall but not rigid... relaxed but alert.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Gently close your eyes, or if you prefer, soften your gaze downward. Begin by taking three deep, intentional breaths. Breathing in through your nose... *[Pause 2 seconds]* ...and out through your mouth. *[Pause 3 seconds]*

Again, breathing in... *[Pause 2 seconds]* ...and releasing. *[Pause 3 seconds]*

One more time. A full, nourishing breath in... *[Pause 2 seconds]* ...and let it all go. *[Pause 3 seconds]*

Beautiful. Now allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm. There's nothing you need to do or change. Simply notice the breath as it is.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

As you sit here in this quiet space between sleep and the day ahead, I invite you to bring your awareness to your body. Notice the contact points... your feet on the floor, your sit bones on the chair or cushion. Feel the weight of your hands resting gently on your lap.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

You are here. You are present. This moment is yours.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Now, bring to mind three things you're grateful for this morning. They don't need to be extraordinary... perhaps it's the comfort of your bed, the warmth of morning light, or simply the fact that you've given yourself these few minutes of presence.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

As each thing comes to mind, let yourself truly feel the gratitude. Notice where you feel it in your body... perhaps a warmth in your chest, a softness around your eyes, or a gentle smile.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Gratitude is the foundation of abundance. By beginning your day from this place of appreciation, you align yourself with the energy of receiving.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Now, I invite you to set an intention for your day. Not a to-do list... but a way of being. How do you want to show up today? What quality do you want to embody?

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Perhaps it's patience... or creativity... or courage... or compassion. Choose one word that resonates.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Silently speak this intention to yourself. "Today, I choose..." and complete the sentence with your word.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Feel this intention settling into your body like a seed being planted. You're not forcing anything... simply setting a gentle direction for your energy.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Now, bring your awareness back to your breath. Notice the natural flow... the rise and fall... the rhythm that's been sustaining you all night and will carry you through this day.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

With each inhale, imagine breathing in fresh energy, clarity, and possibility. With each exhale, releasing anything that doesn't serve you... yesterday's concerns, tension, or heaviness.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Breathing in renewal... *[Pause 2 seconds]* ...breathing out release.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Breathing in vitality... *[Pause 2 seconds]* ...breathing out stagnation.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Your breath is a bridge between your inner world and the outer world. It connects you to this present moment, which is the only moment where life truly happens.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Take a moment to scan your body from head to toe. Notice if there's any remaining tension... in your jaw, your shoulders, your belly. With your next exhale, consciously soften those areas.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Beautiful. You're preparing yourself not just for productivity, but for presence. For showing up fully alive to whatever this day brings.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Begin to deepen your breath slightly. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Roll your shoulders gently back.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

When you're ready, slowly open your eyes or lift your gaze. Take a moment to notice the space around you with fresh eyes, as if seeing it for the first time.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Carry this quality of awareness with you as you move into your day. Remember your intention. Return to your breath whenever you need to come home to yourself.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

You are ready. You are grounded. You are grateful.

Thank you for dedicating this time to yourself. May your day unfold with grace and purpose.

*[Pause 2 seconds]*

Namaste.
