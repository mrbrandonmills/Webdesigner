## Script

Welcome, dear one. Thank you for being here, for giving yourself this sacred time to rest, to release, to surrender into the healing embrace of sleep.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Make yourself completely comfortable in your bed. Adjust your pillows, pull your covers up to just the right warmth, and allow your body to settle into the softness beneath you.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

There is nowhere you need to be, nothing you need to do. This is your time to let go completely.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Gently close your eyes. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and exhale fully through your mouth, releasing the entire day with a gentle sigh.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Again, breathing in peace... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and breathing out tension.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

One more deep breath... filling your lungs completely... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and letting it all flow out, like a wave returning to the ocean.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Now, allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm. Soft, gentle, effortless. Like a sleeping child, your breath knows exactly what to do.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

As we journey together into deep rest, we will travel through your body, releasing each part with loving awareness. There is no rush. We have all the time in the world.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Begin by bringing your attention to your feet. Notice your toes, the soles of your feet, your heels. They've carried you through the entire day. Send them gratitude. With your next exhale, feel all the tiny muscles in your feet softening, releasing, melting into the bed.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Feel this wave of relaxation moving up into your ankles, your lower legs, your calves. The muscles that hold and support you are now being supported by the earth beneath you. Let them rest completely.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

This gentle wave of release flows up into your knees, your thighs. Feel the heaviness of complete relaxation. Your legs are becoming so heavy, so deeply relaxed, sinking into the mattress like stones into soft sand.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Bring your awareness to your hips, your lower back, your entire pelvis. This is where we hold so much of life's burdens. Consciously soften this area. Imagine a warm, golden light dissolving any tension, any holding. Let it all go.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

The wave of peace continues rising up your spine, vertebra by vertebra. Your lower back... your middle back... your upper back. Each breath invites more softening, more letting go. Your spine is supported. You are held. It is safe to release.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Feel your belly soften. There's no need to hold anything in. Let your stomach be soft, your organs at ease. This is where we process not just food, but emotions. Breathe into your belly and exhale any emotional residue from the day.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Your chest, your heart space, expanding and softening with each breath. If there's any tightness here, acknowledge it with compassion. Breathe into your heart. Tell it, "You are safe. You are loved. You can rest now."

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Release your shoulders. So often they carry the weight of our worries. Let them drop, roll back, and melt down into the bed. Feel the space between your shoulders and your ears expanding.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Your arms, from your shoulders down to your fingertips, becoming heavy and warm. Release your elbows, your forearms, your wrists. Soften your hands, each finger relaxing completely. Nothing to hold, nothing to grasp. Just release.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Bring your awareness to your neck. This bridge between body and mind... let it soften. Imagine the muscles of your neck like silk ribbons, gentle and loose.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Your jaw... so often clenched without us realizing. Part your lips slightly. Let your tongue rest softly in your mouth. Relax your jaw completely.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Soften your face. Your cheeks, the muscles around your mouth, your nose. Release any expression. Let your face become smooth, peaceful, like still water.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Your eyes, resting gently in their sockets. The tiny muscles around your eyes completely at ease. Your eyebrows soft. Your forehead wide and smooth.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

The crown of your head, the back of your head against the pillow. Your scalp releasing any final tension.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Your entire body is now in a state of complete relaxation. Heavy, warm, peaceful. Supported by the earth beneath you.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Now, bring your awareness to your breath once more. Notice how gentle it has become. So soft, so quiet. Like waves lapping at the shore on a calm evening.

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

With each breath, you are sinking deeper into relaxation. Each exhale takes you further down into peace. Down, down, down into the softness.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

If thoughts arise, that's perfectly natural. See them as clouds passing through the sky of your mind. You don't need to engage with them. Simply notice, and return to the sensation of your breath... the feeling of your body... the pull of sleep.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Imagine yourself in a place of absolute peace. Perhaps it's a quiet beach at twilight, the sky painted in soft purples and pinks. Or a forest clearing, where the trees stand as gentle guardians. Or a cozy room filled with soft light and warmth.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Wherever you are, you are completely safe. Completely held. Completely loved.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

The day has ended. You have done enough. You are enough. There is nothing left to prove, nothing left to do.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Your only job now is to surrender. To trust. To let go.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Feel yourself floating on a gentle river that is carrying you toward sleep. You don't need to swim or effort. The river knows the way. You are being carried in loving arms toward deep, restorative rest.

*[Pause 12 seconds]*

With each breath, you drift further. Each exhale takes you deeper into the healing darkness of sleep.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Your body knows how to heal itself as you sleep. Your cells regenerate. Your mind processes and integrates. Your spirit renews. Sleep is sacred medicine.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Let go... let go... let go...

*[Pause 15 seconds]*

Breathing in peace... *[Pause 5 seconds]* ...breathing out completely...

*[Pause 15 seconds]*

Sinking deeper... deeper... into the soft embrace of sleep...

*[Pause 20 seconds]*

You are safe. You are loved. You are at peace.

*[Pause 20 seconds]*

May you rest in the deepest sleep. May you wake renewed and whole.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Sleep now, dear one. Sleep.

*[Pause 30 seconds, then fade out]*
