## Script

Welcome. You're here because you're ready to step into your power. Not power over others, but power within yourself. True confidence. Unshakeable self-worth. Let's activate that now.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Sit or stand tall. Feel your spine lengthen. Shoulders back and down. Chest open. This is the posture of someone who knows their value.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Hold it at the top. *[Pause 3 seconds]* Now exhale powerfully through your mouth, releasing any doubt, any insecurity.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Again. Breathe in strength, breathe in certainty. *[Pause 3 seconds]* Exhale everything that's been holding you back.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

One more. Breathe in your power. *[Pause 3 seconds]* Breathe out anything that says you're not enough.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Here's the truth: confidence is not something you gain from external validation. It's not something you earn through achievement. True confidence is your birthright. It's been within you all along, perhaps just buried under years of conditioning and self-doubt.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

We're going to reconnect you with that innate power right now.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Bring your awareness to your core, your center, just below your navel. In many traditions, this is considered the seat of personal power. Imagine there's a ball of glowing, golden light there.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

With each breath, this light grows brighter, warmer, more intense. This is your power. This is your confidence. It's not arrogant. It's not aggressive. It's simply solid, grounded, certain.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Feel this energy beginning to radiate outward from your core. It fills your belly, your chest, flows down into your legs, making you feel rooted to the earth like an ancient oak tree.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

This power flows up through your spine, straightening it, strengthening it. It fills your shoulders, your arms. You feel strong. Capable. Ready.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

It rises into your throat, your voice. When you speak from this place, people listen. Not because you're loud, but because you're certain.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

It fills your head, your mind. You think clearly. You decide decisively. You trust yourself.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Now, think of a situation where you've felt unsure of yourself recently. Perhaps it's a conversation you need to have, a decision you need to make, a room you need to walk into.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Imagine yourself in that situation now, but this time, you're filled with this golden light of power and confidence. How do you stand? How do you speak? How do you move through the world?

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Notice the difference. When you're connected to your power, you don't need to prove anything. You don't need anyone's approval. You simply are.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

This is who you actually are beneath the fear. This capable, powerful, confident being. This is your natural state.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Now, I want you to make a sound. Yes, out loud. A powerful sound from deep in your belly. It could be a hum, an "ahhh," a "yes," whatever feels right. Let it be strong. Let it vibrate through your entire body.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Do it again, louder. Feel the power of your own voice.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

One more time. Let it roar if it wants to. This is your power finding its voice.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Good. Feel that vibration still echoing in your body. That's your power, your confidence, activated and alive.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Place both hands on your chest, over your heart. Feel the steady, strong beat. This heart has been beating your whole life. It doesn't doubt. It doesn't hesitate. It just does what it was made to do, powerfully and confidently.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

You can learn from your heart. You were made to show up fully. To take up space. To use your gifts. To speak your truth.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Say these words out loud, with conviction: "I am powerful. I am confident. I am worthy."

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Again, louder: "I am powerful. I am confident. I am worthy."

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

One more time, like you absolutely mean it: "I am powerful. I am confident. I am worthy."

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Feel those words settle into your bones, your cells, your being. They're not affirmations you're trying to believe. They're rememberings. You're remembering what has always been true.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Before you leave this practice, make one commitment. One action you're going to take from this place of power. Maybe it's having that difficult conversation. Setting that boundary. Going after that opportunity. Making that decision.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Commit to it now. Feel yourself doing it, with full confidence.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Take one more deep breath. As you exhale, let this feeling of power and confidence settle deep into your body. You can access this anytime you need it. It's always here. It's who you are.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Roll your shoulders back. Stand or sit even taller. When you open your eyes, meet the world with a steady gaze.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Open your eyes.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

You are powerful. You are confident. You are worthy.

*[Pause 2 seconds]*

Now go show the world.
