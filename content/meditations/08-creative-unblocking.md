## Script

Hello, creative soul! Welcome to this practice. If you're here, it probably means you're feeling stuck, blocked, or disconnected from your creative flow. Well, I have good news: that flow is still there. It's always there. We're just going to help you get out of your own way.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Get comfortable, but stay alert. This isn't about falling asleep; it's about waking up to your creative potential. Sit up, shake out your shoulders, maybe even smile a little.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Take a big breath in through your nose... *[Pause 2 seconds]* ...and sigh it out through your mouth. Let it be audible. Ahhhhh.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Again, breathe in possibility... *[Pause 2 seconds]* ...and sigh out all the "shoulds," all the pressure, all the expectations. Ahhhhhh.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

One more. Breathe in playfulness... *[Pause 2 seconds]* ...and release perfectionism. Ahhhhhh.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Here's the thing about creative blocks: they're usually not about lack of ideas or lack of talent. They're about fear. Fear of being bad, fear of being judged, fear of not living up to some imaginary standard you've set for yourself.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

So let's release that right now. Close your eyes and imagine that all the expectations you have for yourself, all the "I should be better by now" and "this isn't good enough" thoughts... imagine them as physical objects you're carrying in a backpack.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Feel how heavy they are. That weight has been exhausting you, hasn't it?

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Now, in your mind's eye, take off that backpack and set it down. Just put it down. You don't need to carry it anymore. Not right now. Maybe not ever.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Notice how much lighter you feel. How much more space there is to breathe, to play, to create.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Let's go back to the beginning, before you learned to judge your creativity. Think about when you were a child. Remember drawing or singing or making up stories just for the sheer joy of it?

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

You didn't worry if it was good. You didn't compare yourself to others. You just created because it felt good. Because it was fun. Because you had something inside you that wanted to come out.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

That child is still in you. That pure, unselfconscious creator. We're going to reconnect with them now.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Place your hands on your belly and breathe deeply. This is your creative center. In many traditions, it's called the sacral chakra. It's where your creative life force lives.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Imagine a warm, orange glow there. With each breath, it gets brighter, warmer. This is your creative energy, your inspiration, your original ideas.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Feel it swirling, wanting to move, wanting to be expressed. It doesn't care if what you make is perfect. It just wants to flow.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Now, I'm going to ask you a question, and I want you to notice the very first answer that pops into your head, before your inner critic has time to interfere.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

If you could create anything at all, with no judgment, no need to show anyone, no pressure for it to be good, what would you make?

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Whatever came up, that's your creative wisdom speaking. That's what wants to come through you.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

You don't have to act on it right now, but notice it. Honor it. That little whisper is important.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Here's your permission slip, the one you've been waiting for: You are allowed to create badly. You are allowed to make mistakes. You are allowed to experiment and play and have no idea what you're doing.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

In fact, that's where the best stuff comes from. Not from perfection, but from permission. Permission to try, to fail, to try again differently.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Take another deep breath into your creative center. Feel that orange glow spreading throughout your body. Up into your chest, down into your legs, out through your arms and into your hands.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Your hands want to create. Your voice wants to express. Your mind wants to imagine. Let them.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Before you finish this practice, I want you to make one small commitment. Not to create a masterpiece, but to create something. Today or tomorrow. It could be as simple as doodling for five minutes, humming a made-up melody, writing one terrible paragraph, moving your body in a new way.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Something small. Something pressure-free. Something just for you.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Say it to yourself now: "I will create..." and fill in the blank.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Good. You've made a promise to your creative self. That matters.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Now, let's seal this practice with energy. Rub your hands together vigorously, fast, creating heat and friction.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Stop, and hold your palms about an inch apart. Feel that tingle, that energy. That's your creative life force. It's real. It's powerful. It's yours.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Place those energized hands on your heart. Let that creative energy fill you up.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Take one more big breath in... *[Pause 2 seconds]* ...and let it out with a smile.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

When you open your eyes, see the world with fresh, creative eyes. Notice colors, textures, light, shadow. Let yourself be inspired by ordinary things.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Open your eyes.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

You are creative. Not because you're special, but because you're human. Creativity is your birthright.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Now go make something. Anything. And remember: done is better than perfect, and playful is better than both.

*[Pause 2 seconds]*

Go create!
