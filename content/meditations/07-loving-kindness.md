## Script

Welcome, dear heart. In this practice, we will open the gates of compassion, first to ourselves, and then radiating outward to all beings. This is the ancient practice of loving-kindness, of metta.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Find a comfortable seat. Place your hands over your heart, one hand on top of the other. Feel the warmth there, the steady rhythm of your heartbeat.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Close your eyes softly. Take a deep, nourishing breath in... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...and a gentle breath out.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Two more breaths like this, breathing in love... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...breathing out tension.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Breathing in compassion... *[Pause 3 seconds]* ...breathing out hardness.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

We begin this practice with ourselves, because we cannot truly offer others what we do not give to ourselves. Many of us find this the hardest part, but it is also the most important.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

With your hands still on your heart, I want you to bring to mind an image of yourself. Not as you wish you were, but as you are right now. See yourself with all your beauty and all your flaws, all your strengths and all your struggles.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Now, as if speaking to a beloved child, offer yourself these phrases. You can say them silently or whisper them aloud:

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

"May I be safe."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May I be healthy."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May I be peaceful."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May I live with ease."

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Say them again, and this time, really feel the words. Mean them.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

"May I be safe."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May I be healthy."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May I be peaceful."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May I live with ease."

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

If resistance comes up, that's natural. We're so used to being hard on ourselves. Just notice the resistance and return to the phrases, softening a little more each time.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Now, bring to mind someone who loves you unconditionally. Perhaps a parent, a grandparent, a dear friend, a teacher, even a pet. Someone whose face lights up when they see you.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Picture them clearly. See the warmth in their eyes, their smile, the way they care for you.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Offer them these same phrases:

"May you be safe."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May you be healthy."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May you be peaceful."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May you live with ease."

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Feel the love flowing from your heart to theirs. This is easy, natural. This is how your heart wants to be.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Now, think of someone neutral in your life. Someone you see regularly but don't know well. Perhaps the person at the coffee shop, a neighbor, someone you pass on your daily walk.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

This person, like you, wants to be happy. They too have struggles, dreams, pain, joy. They too deserve compassion.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Offer them the phrases:

"May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be peaceful. May you live with ease."

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Notice how it feels to extend kindness to someone you don't know well. You're beginning to see that all beings are worthy of love.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Now comes the more challenging part, but also the most liberating. Think of someone with whom you have difficulty. Someone who has hurt you, angered you, or whom you simply find challenging.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

You don't have to choose the most difficult person in your life. Start small if you need to.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Remember, offering them loving-kindness doesn't mean you approve of their actions or even that you must have them in your life. It simply means you release yourself from the prison of resentment.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

See if you can recognize that this person, too, is struggling. Hurt people hurt people. They are suffering in their own way.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

With whatever compassion you can muster, even if it's just a tiny seed, offer the phrases:

"May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be peaceful. May you live with ease."

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

If this feels too hard, you can modify it: "May we both find peace. May we both be free from suffering."

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

Take a deep breath. You are practicing the highest form of strength, which is compassion in the face of difficulty.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Now, expand your awareness even further. Imagine all beings in your community. All the people in your city, your country, your world.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

See humanity in all its beautiful diversity. Every person with their own story, their own pain, their own hope.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Offer loving-kindness to all:

"May all beings be safe."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May all beings be healthy."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May all beings be peaceful."

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May all beings live with ease."

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Expand even further. Include all creatures, all animals, all life. The birds, the fish, the insects, the trees. Everything that lives and breathes.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

"May all beings be safe. May all beings be healthy. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings live with ease."

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Feel your heart expanding. You are not separate from this web of life. Your happiness is connected to the happiness of all beings.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

And finally, bring the loving-kindness back to yourself, full circle. Place your hands on your heart once more.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

"May I be safe. May I be healthy. May I be peaceful. May I live with ease."

*[Pause 7 seconds]*

You are worthy of the same compassion you offer others. You are deserving of love, especially your own.

*[Pause 6 seconds]*

Sit quietly for a moment, feeling whatever is present. Perhaps warmth, perhaps openness, perhaps emotion. All of it is welcome.

*[Pause 8 seconds]*

Take a deep breath in, gathering all this loving energy. *[Pause 3 seconds]* And breathe out, letting it settle into every cell of your being.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

When you're ready, gently open your eyes.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

Carry this loving-kindness with you. Let it inform how you see yourself, how you see others, how you move through the world.

*[Pause 4 seconds]*

May you be filled with loving-kindness. May you be well.

*[Pause 3 seconds]*

Namaste.
