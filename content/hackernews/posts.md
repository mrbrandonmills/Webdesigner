Title: Show HN: Dream Decoder AI – Jungian dream analysis with 3D visualization

URL: https://brandonmills.com/dream-decoder

Built this free tool that analyzes dreams using Jungian psychology instead of generic dream dictionaries.

Technical approach:
- LLM-based analysis trained on Jungian archetypal patterns
- Context-aware symbol interpretation (same symbol can mean different things)
- Three.js 3D visualization of dream landscapes
- Structured output for archetypes, symbols, interpretation

Why Jungian? Jung's framework treats symbols as personal, not universal. A snake doesn't always mean transformation—it depends on the dreamer's context and the full dream narrative.

The challenge was getting the AI to go beyond surface-level interpretation and actually analyze symbols contextually, like a trained analyst would.

Stack: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Three.js, Gemini API

Would love feedback on the psychological accuracy and technical implementation.

Title: Show HN: Free AI tool for Jungian dream analysis

URL: https://brandonmills.com/dream-decoder

I built a free dream interpretation tool that uses actual Jungian psychological framework instead of dream dictionary definitions.

Most dream tools give generic meanings ("water = emotions"). Real Jungian analysis considers:
- Full dream context
- Symbol relationships
- Archetypal patterns (Shadow, Anima/Animus, Hero, etc.)
- Individual dreamer's psyche

Features:
- Context-aware symbol analysis
- Archetypal pattern identification
- Personalized interpretation
- 3D visualization of dream content

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Three.js, and Gemini for the analysis.

Completely free, no signups. Happy to discuss the technical implementation or psychological framework.

Title: Ask HN: How do you approach dream journaling/analysis?

I've been studying Jungian dream analysis and built a tool to help interpret dreams (link in profile).

Curious how others here approach dreams:

1. Do you keep a dream journal?
2. Do you try to interpret dreams or just record them?
3. Have you found any patterns over time?
4. Any tools or methods you use?

Jung believed dreams are the psyche processing experiences and communicating truths we're not ready to face consciously. The challenge is interpretation—symbols are personal, not universal.

Would love to hear different approaches from this community.

Title: Jungian dream analysis: Why context matters more than dream dictionaries

URL: https://brandonmills.com/blog/jungian-dream-interpretation-guide

Dream dictionaries give the same meaning to everyone: "snake = transformation." But that's not how dream analysis actually works.

Jung's approach treats every symbol as personal. A snake might represent transformation for one person, danger for another, healing for a third—depending on their relationship to snakes, the dream's full context, and what's happening in their life.

This post explains:
- Why universal dream meanings are misleading
- How Jungian analysis interprets symbols in context
- The major archetypes and what they represent
- How to start analyzing your own dreams

Title: Show HN: Three.js dream visualization from text descriptions

URL: https://brandonmills.com/dream-decoder

Side project that generates 3D visualizations of dreams based on text analysis.

When you describe a dream, the tool:
1. Extracts key symbols and settings
2. Determines mood/atmosphere
3. Generates a Three.js scene representing the dreamscape

The visualization isn't meant to be literal—it's more about capturing the feeling and key elements.

Technical details:
- LLM extracts structured data from dream text
- Custom Three.js scene generator
- Procedural elements based on symbol categories
- Atmospheric effects based on mood analysis

The main product is actually dream interpretation using Jungian psychology, but the visualization has been an interesting challenge.

Would love feedback on the 3D generation approach.

Title: The Shadow archetype in dreams: What your nightmares might be telling you

URL: https://brandonmills.com/blog/shadow-archetype-dreams

Jung's Shadow is one of the most important concepts for understanding dreams, especially nightmares.

The Shadow represents parts of yourself you've rejected or denied—traits you consider unacceptable. In dreams, it often appears as:
- Threatening figures
- Monsters or villains
- People you dislike
- Dark or frightening scenarios

The key insight: these aren't external threats. They're disowned parts of your own psyche asking to be acknowledged.

This post covers how to identify Shadow content in dreams and what it means for personal development.
