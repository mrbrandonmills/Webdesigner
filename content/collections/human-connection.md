# Human Connection: Portraits of Authenticity

## Collection Overview

In an age of curated personas and filtered reality, genuine human connection becomes increasingly precious—and increasingly difficult to capture.

**Human Connection** is a portrait collection that celebrates authentic emotion, vulnerability, and the complex depth of human experience. Each image is created through genuine collaboration between photographer and subject, revealing moments of truth that transcend the polished artifice dominating contemporary portraiture.

## The Philosophy

### Beyond the Surface

Traditional portrait photography often focuses on surface perfection—ideal lighting, flawless skin, perfect poses. These images can be beautiful, but they rarely reveal anything true about the subject.

Human Connection takes a different approach:

**Collaboration Over Direction**
Subjects aren't told how to pose or what to feel. Instead, we create space for authentic moments to emerge through conversation, patience, and genuine rapport.

**Imperfection as Truth**
A furrowed brow, uncertain eyes, a hand reaching to fix hair—these "imperfect" moments often contain more truth than polished poses.

**Context and Environment**
Many portraits include environmental elements that reveal something about the subject's life, work, or character. The background isn't just backdrop—it's context.

**Technical Excellence in Service of Truth**
Every technical decision—lighting, composition, depth of field—serves the goal of revealing authentic character, not creating artificial perfection.

## The Process

### How These Portraits Are Created

**Pre-Shoot Conversation**

Every session begins with extended conversation, often over coffee or while walking. This isn't small talk—it's the foundation of collaboration.

I want to understand:
- What brings you to this moment
- What you hope to reveal (or not reveal)
- What matters to you
- What makes you uncomfortable

**The Session**

Portrait sessions typically run 2-3 hours—far longer than standard sessions. This extended time allows initial nervousness to fade and genuine moments to emerge.

There's no formula. Some sessions involve elaborate lighting setups. Others use only natural window light. Some subjects feel comfortable with direct eye contact. Others reveal more looking away.

The goal is always the same: create space for authentic moments.

**Selection and Editing**

After the session, I review hundreds or thousands of frames to identify the moments that truly reveal something. Often, the best images aren't the most technically perfect—they're the ones where you can see the person's genuine character.

Post-processing enhances without distorting. Skin retouching is minimal. The goal is to create a photograph that feels like meeting the person, not admiring a mannequin.

## Featured Portraits

### "Contemplation" - Limited Edition 12/50

A portrait of [subject, with permission] captured during a moment of genuine introspection. The soft window light, the slight furrow of concentration, the hands unconsciously clasped—everything speaks to authentic presence.

This image represents everything the Human Connection collection aspires to achieve: technical excellence, compositional grace, and genuine emotional truth.

**Technical Details:**
- Natural window light with minimal fill
- 85mm f/1.4 lens for shallow depth of field
- Minimal retouching, preserving skin texture
- Converted to subtle black and white

**Edition:** 50 prints maximum, hand-signed and numbered

**Why This Works:**

The subject wasn't performing. She was genuinely lost in thought, briefly forgetting the camera existed. That moment of authentic presence transforms a technically excellent portrait into something meaningful.

### "The Artist's Hands"

Not all portraits show faces. This study of a sculptor's hands—weathered, strong, stained with clay—reveals as much character as any facial portrait.

**Available as:**
- Fine art prints (multiple sizes)
- Metal prints (particularly stunning for this image)
- Open edition

---

### "Father and Daughter"

The relationship between people can be as compelling as the individuals themselves. This portrait captures a quiet moment between father and daughter—his protective hand on her shoulder, her complete trust evident in her relaxed posture.

These multi-person portraits require even more patience and collaboration, but when they work, they're extraordinarily powerful.

**Limited Edition:** 50 prints

---

## Technical Approach

### The Tools and Techniques

**Cameras and Lenses:**

- **Bodies:** High-resolution full-frame cameras for maximum detail
- **Primary lenses:** 50mm f/1.4, 85mm f/1.4, 105mm f/1.4
- **Why fast primes:** Shallow depth of field isolates subjects while maintaining beautiful image quality

**Lighting:**

Every image uses one of three approaches:

1. **Natural Light:** Window light or outdoor shade
2. **Minimal Artificial:** Single softbox or umbrella for controlled natural look
3. **Dramatic Artificial:** Multiple lights for sculptural, dramatic portraits

The choice depends entirely on the subject and the mood we're creating together.

**Processing:**

- Minimal skin retouching (preserving texture and reality)
- Careful attention to color or black-and-white conversion
- Emphasis on eyes (subtle sharpening and contrast)
- Overall polish without artificial perfection

## Black and White vs. Color

### Choosing the Right Treatment

Roughly half of Human Connection images are presented in black and white, the other half in color. The choice isn't arbitrary—it's based on what each image needs.

**Black and White When:**
- Color would distract from expression
- The image is primarily about light and form
- Timeless quality serves the subject
- Environmental colors are chaotic or distracting

**Color When:**
- Color reveals something about the subject
- Skin tones are particularly beautiful
- Environmental context matters
- The image benefits from warmth/coolness

Some images are available in both treatments, allowing collectors to choose based on their space and preferences.

---

## Limited Edition Structure

### 50 Prints per Image

Most Human Connection portraits are limited to 50 prints—twice the edition size of Urban Poetry, but still genuinely scarce.

**Why 50?**

Portrait photography has broader appeal than architectural work. An edition of 25 would sell out too quickly, preventing many collectors from accessing images they connect with.

Fifty prints is small enough to maintain value and exclusivity while allowing the work to reach those who genuinely appreciate it.

**The Promise:**

As with all limited editions, 50 means 50. Forever. Once sold, the edition is closed permanently.

## In Collectors' Homes

### How to Display Human Connection

**Personal Spaces:**

Portraits carry emotional weight—display them in spaces where you spend meaningful time:

- Bedrooms (particularly family portraits)
- Home offices (inspiring or contemplative images)
- Reading nooks and personal libraries
- Entryways (welcoming guests with humanity)

**Size Recommendations:**

- **Intimate spaces:** 16×20" to 20×30"
- **Living rooms:** 24×36" to 30×40"
- **Large walls:** 40×60" (select images only)

**Framing:**

Human Connection portraits are often framed with wider mats than architectural work, creating breathing room around the subject.

**Recommended:**
- 4-6 inch museum matting
- Simple frames that don't compete with subject
- UV-protective glazing (always)

---

## Ethics and Permissions

### Respecting Subjects

Every person photographed for Human Connection has:

- **Signed model releases** for commercial use
- **Seen and approved** final images before publication
- **The right to decline** specific images even after shooting

For commissioned portraits, you own the right to all personal use of images. I retain the right to display selected images in portfolio contexts with your permission.

## Collecting Strategy

### Building Your Human Connection Collection

**Single Powerful Piece:**

Many collectors start with one portrait that speaks to them personally—a particular expression, mood, or quality of light.

**Recommended approach:** Choose based on emotional resonance, not market calculation.

**Curated Series:**

Some collectors build mini-collections of 3-5 related portraits—all black and white, all contemplative expressions, all natural light, etc.

**Recommended:** Mix of sizes creates visual interest while maintaining cohesion.

**Investment Focus:**

For collectors focused on value appreciation, prioritize:
- Lower edition numbers (1-15 of 50)
- Black and white portraits (historically more collectible)
- Images with exhibition history
- Portraits of notable subjects (when available)

---
