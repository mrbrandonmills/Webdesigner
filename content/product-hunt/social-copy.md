### Post 2: The Problem We Solve
```
Most dream interpretation tools are like horoscopes.

"Water means emotions"
"Flying means freedom"

That's not how dream analysis works.

Dream Decoder interprets symbols in YOUR unique context using real Jungian psychology.

### Post 3: Behind the Build
```
Why I built Dream Decoder:

I spent months studying Jungian psychology and realized—this shouldn't be locked behind expensive therapy or years of study.

Your subconscious is speaking to you every night. You deserve to understand it.

Now live on @ProductHunt (and free forever): [Link]
```

### Post 4: Feature Highlight - 3D Visuals
```
One of my favorite features in Dream Decoder:

3D visualizations of your dreams.

There's something about SEEING your dream symbols that helps you remember and process them differently than just reading about them.

### Post 5: The Jungian Difference
```
Dream dictionaries: "Snakes mean transformation"

Jungian analysis: "What does the snake mean to YOU given the full context of your dream?"

Dream Decoder AI does the latter.

### Post 1: Main Launch Announcement
```
Today I'm launching Dream Decoder AI on Product Hunt.

It's a free tool that uses Jungian psychology to analyze your dreams.

Here's why I built it:

Most dream interpretation tools give you generic definitions. "Water means emotions." "Flying means freedom." That's not real dream analysis.

Carl Jung spent his career developing a framework for understanding dreams as messages from the subconscious. His work revealed how archetypal symbols—the Shadow, the Anima/Animus, the Hero—appear in our dreams to communicate truths we're not ready to face consciously.

The problem? Real Jungian analysis requires years of study or expensive sessions with trained analysts.

Dream Decoder changes that.

When you input your dream, our AI:
- Identifies symbols in context (not dictionary definitions)
- Recognizes archetypal patterns
- Generates personalized interpretations
- Creates 3D visualizations of your dreamscape

And it's completely free. No subscriptions, no limits.

I believe everyone deserves access to their own subconscious.

If you're curious about what your dreams are trying to tell you, I'd love for you to try it:

### Post 2: The Journey/Story
```
Three months ago, I had a dream that wouldn't leave me alone.

I looked it up in dream dictionaries online. "Bridge means transition." "Water means emotions." Useless.

So I started reading Jung. Really reading him. And I realized—dream analysis is a skill. It requires understanding archetypes, symbols, context, and the individual dreamer's psyche.

But why should that be locked behind expensive therapy?

Today I'm launching Dream Decoder AI on Product Hunt.

It's not a dream dictionary. It's a tool that interprets YOUR dreams using real Jungian psychological framework:

- Symbol analysis in full context
- Archetypal pattern recognition
- Personalized interpretation
- 3D dream visualizations

And it's free. Forever.

Dreams are the subconscious speaking. Everyone deserves to understand the message.

What's the most impactful dream you've ever had?

### Post 3: Problem/Solution
```
The dream interpretation industry is broken.

Generic dream dictionaries that give the same meaning to everyone: "Snake = transformation"

Expensive therapists who may or may not specialize in dream work: $150+/session

No middle ground for people who want meaningful analysis without the cost.

Today I'm fixing that.

Dream Decoder AI uses Jungian psychology—real archetypal analysis—to interpret your dreams.

Key differences:
- Context-aware (not one-size-fits-all definitions)
- Recognizes archetypal patterns (Shadow, Anima, Hero, etc.)
- Beautiful 3D visualizations
- Completely free

We're live on Product Hunt today.

### Post 4: Educational/Value-Driven
```
Most people don't know how to interpret their dreams.

Here's what Jung taught us:

Dreams aren't random. They're the psyche's way of processing experiences and communicating truths we're not ready to face consciously.

Symbols in dreams aren't universal—they're personal. A snake might mean transformation for one person and danger for another, depending on context.

Recurring themes often represent archetypal patterns:
- The Shadow (disowned parts of self)
- The Anima/Animus (inner feminine/masculine)
- The Self (wholeness and integration)

Understanding these patterns can unlock genuine self-awareness.

That's why I built Dream Decoder AI—to make this framework accessible.

It's live on Product Hunt today, and it's free: [Link]

What symbol keeps appearing in your dreams?

### Post 5: Social Proof/Results
```
Just launched Dream Decoder AI on Product Hunt.

In the first [X] hours:
- [X] people tried it
- [X] dreams analyzed

The response has been incredible.

But more than the numbers, it's the messages.

"This is exactly what I was looking for"
"Finally something that goes deeper than dictionary definitions"
"The 3D visualization helped me remember symbols I'd forgotten"

This is why I built it—to help people understand their subconscious.

Thank you to everyone who's supported the launch!

Hey r/Dreams!

Long-time lurker here. I've been frustrated with dream interpretation tools for years—they all give generic definitions without understanding context.

So I built Dream Decoder AI. It uses Jungian psychological framework to analyze dreams:

What it does:
- Analyzes symbols in the full context of YOUR dream (not dictionary definitions)
- Identifies archetypal patterns (Shadow, Anima/Animus, etc.)
- Generates 3D visualizations of your dreamscape
- Explains what your subconscious might be processing

It's completely free—no signups, no subscriptions, no limits.

We just launched on Product Hunt today and I'd love feedback from this community. What features would make this more useful for your dream practice?

[Link]

Happy to answer any questions about the psychology framework or how it works!

### r/Jung

**Title:** Built an AI tool for Jungian dream analysis - looking for feedback from this community

**Body:**
```
Hello fellow Jung enthusiasts,

I've been studying Jung for several years and always wished there was a way to make dream analysis more accessible. Jungian dream work requires understanding archetypes, symbols in context, and the individual's psychological landscape—skills that take years to develop.

So I built Dream Decoder AI to bridge that gap.

It's not a replacement for real analytical work, but it's a starting point that's grounded in actual Jungian theory:

- Symbol analysis in full context (not generic dream dictionary definitions)
- Archetypal pattern identification (Shadow, Anima/Animus, Self, etc.)
- Personalized interpretation based on dream narrative
- 3D visualizations of dream landscapes

Important note: I'm not claiming this replaces working with a trained analyst. But for people curious about their dreams who don't have access to analysis, it's a meaningful entry point.

I launched it on Product Hunt today and it's completely free. Would love feedback from this community on the psychological accuracy and what would make it more useful.

How do you approach your own dream analysis?

**Title:** Built a free Jungian dream analysis AI tool - looking for professional feedback

Hi everyone,

I'm launching a free AI tool called Dream Decoder that helps people interpret their dreams using Jungian psychological framework.

I want to be very clear: this is NOT a replacement for therapy or working with a trained analyst. It's a self-reflection tool for people who are curious about their dreams but don't have access to professional dream work.

The tool:
- Analyzes symbols in context (not generic definitions)
- Identifies potential archetypal patterns
- Offers interpretations grounded in Jungian theory
- Creates visual representations of dream content

I'm reaching out to this community because I'd value professional feedback:
- Is the psychological framework sound?
- Are there risks I should be more explicit about?
- Would this be useful to recommend to clients as a journaling supplement?
- What disclaimers should I add?

It's live on Product Hunt and completely free: [Link]

I'm committed to making this responsible and would genuinely appreciate critical feedback from professionals.

### r/ArtificialIntelligence or r/MachineLearning

**Title:** Launched an AI dream interpreter that uses Jungian psychology instead of generic dream dictionaries

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

Just launched Dream Decoder AI on Product Hunt. It analyzes dreams using a Jungian psychological framework rather than giving generic dream dictionary definitions.

The technical approach:
- LLM-based analysis trained to identify archetypal patterns
- Context-aware symbol interpretation (same symbol can mean different things for different dreamers)
- 3D visualization generation of dream content
- Structured output for archetypes, symbols, and interpretation

Why Jungian psychology? Jung developed the most comprehensive framework for understanding dreams as communications from the subconscious. His work on archetypes (Shadow, Anima/Animus, the Self) provides a rich ontology for categorizing dream content.

The challenge was getting the AI to go beyond surface-level interpretation and actually analyze symbols in context, the way a trained Jungian analyst would.

It's free to use: [Link]

Would love technical feedback and questions about the approach!

Hi r/productivity!

Dreams are basically free nightly therapy sessions from your subconscious—but most people don't know how to interpret them.

I built Dream Decoder AI to help. It uses Jungian psychology to analyze your dreams and surface insights about what your mind is processing.

How it's useful for self-improvement:
- Understand recurring themes and what they mean
- Identify "shadow" content (disowned parts of yourself)
- Process emotions you might not be consciously aware of
- Get a different perspective on challenges you're facing

The tool:
- Analyzes symbols in YOUR specific context
- Identifies archetypal patterns
- Generates personalized interpretations
- Creates 3D visualizations

It's completely free. Just launched on Product Hunt today: [Link]

Do you pay attention to your dreams? What patterns have you noticed?

### r/meditation or r/Mindfulness

**Title:** Built a free Jungian dream analysis tool - for those who work with dreams as part of their practice

**Body:**
```
Hello,

For those who incorporate dream work into their mindfulness practice, I wanted to share a tool I built.

Dream Decoder AI analyzes dreams using Jungian psychological framework. Jung saw dreams as messages from the unconscious that help us integrate disowned parts of ourselves and move toward wholeness.

The tool:
- Identifies symbols in context (not generic meanings)
- Recognizes archetypal patterns
- Provides interpretations grounded in depth psychology
- Creates visual representations

I'm not positioning this as mindfulness per se, but I know many practitioners here work with dreams as part of their self-awareness practice.

It's free to use: [Link]

How do dreams fit into your practice?
