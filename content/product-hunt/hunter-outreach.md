### Template 4: Email Outreach (If You Have Their Email)

**Subject:** Dream Decoder AI - Seeking Hunter for Product Hunt Launch

---

Hi [First Name],

I hope this finds you well. I've been impressed by your Product Hunt curation—especially [specific product] and [specific product]. You have a knack for spotting tools that genuinely help people.

I'm reaching out because I'm launching **Dream Decoder AI** and believe it aligns with the types of products you hunt.

**The pitch in 30 seconds:**
Dream Decoder uses AI trained on Jungian analytical psychology to interpret dreams. Unlike generic dream dictionaries that give everyone the same symbol definitions, it analyzes symbols in the full context of the dreamer's unique narrative. It also generates stunning 3D visualizations of dream landscapes.

**Why I built it:**
I was frustrated that real dream analysis required expensive therapy or years of studying Jung. I wanted to make that depth accessible to everyone—for free.

**Key differentiators:**
- Jungian archetypal framework (Shadow, Anima/Animus, etc.)
- Context-aware symbol interpretation
- 3D dream visualizations
- 100% free, no limits

**Launch timeline:** [Target date] (flexible based on your availability)

I'd be thrilled if you'd consider hunting Dream Decoder. Happy to provide:
- Full product demo
- Behind-the-scenes on the psychology framework
- Any assets or information you need

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if it's a fit?

Thank you for your time—and for everything you do for the maker community.

Best,
