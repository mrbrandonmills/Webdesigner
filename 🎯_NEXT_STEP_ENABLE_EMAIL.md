# 🎯 NEXT STEP: Enable Email for Your Store

## ✅ What's Working Now

Your store is **LIVE** at https://brandonmills.com with:
- ✅ Stripe payments (LIVE mode)
- ✅ Printful integration
- ✅ Shopping cart
- ✅ Admin dashboard
- ✅ All API keys configured

## 📧 What's Missing: Email

**Your store can't send emails yet** because DNS records aren't configured.

**Without email working:**
- ❌ No order confirmations to customers
- ❌ No admin notifications for new sales
- ❌ No shipping updates

## 🚀 How to Fix (5 Minutes Setup, 1 Hour Wait)

### Option 1: Quick Copy/Paste Version (Fastest)
```
File: DNS_RECORDS_COPY_PASTE.txt
```
Just the DNS records to copy/paste. No explanations.

### Option 2: Tucows/Hover Specific (Recommended)
```
File: DNS_SETUP_TUCOWS.md
```
Step-by-step for your specific registrar (detected: Tucows/Hover).

### Option 3: Detailed Guide (All Registrars)
```
File: DNS_SETUP_GUIDE.md
```
Complete instructions for any domain registrar.

## 📋 Quick Summary

**You need to add 4 DNS records at your domain registrar:**

1. **TXT record** - Domain verification (DKIM)
2. **MX record** - Email routing
3. **TXT record** - Sender authentication (SPF)
4. **TXT record** - DMARC policy (optional)

**Where to add them:**
- Login to where you manage brandonmills.com
- Find "DNS Settings" or "DNS Management"
- Add the 4 records
- Save changes
- Wait 10-60 minutes

**Then verify:**
- Go to https://resend.com/domains
- Click "Verify" on brandonmills.com
- Wait for green checkmarks ✅

## 🎯 What Happens After Email Works

Once DNS is verified, **everything is automatic:**

### When a customer makes a purchase:
1. ✅ Payment processed by Stripe
2. ✅ Order sent to Printful for printing/shipping
3. ✅ **Customer receives order confirmation email**
4. ✅ **You receive admin notification email**
5. ✅ Customer charged
6. ✅ You get paid

### When Printful ships the product:
1. ✅ **Customer receives shipping notification**
2. ✅ **Tracking number included**
3. ✅ Professional branded email from your domain
