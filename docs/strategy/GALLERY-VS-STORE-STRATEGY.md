# Gallery vs. Store Strategy
## Brandon Mills Website Architecture

**Created:** November 15, 2025
**Purpose:** Clarify what goes where and why

---

## The Two Pillars

### 1. GALLERY (Portfolio - Books Work)
**URL:** `/gallery`
**Purpose:** Showcase modeling range to book professional gigs
**Audience:** Photographers, agencies, brands, casting directors
**Content:** Professional photo shoots (AM Reed, etc.)
**Monetization:** INDIRECT (books paid modeling work)
**Vibe:** Museum-quality presentation, artistic credibility

**What Goes Here:**
- Photo shoots with professional photographers
- Editorial campaigns
- Fashion lookbook work
- Behind-the-scenes process
- Artistic collaborations
- Range demonstration (formal, casual, underwear, artistic)

**NOT For Sale:** These images showcase skills, not products

---

### 2. STORE (E-commerce - Generates Revenue)
**URL:** `/store`
**Purpose:** Sell products (books, software, YOUR photography)
**Audience:** Fans, collectors, readers, clients
**Content:** Products you created/authored
**Monetization:** DIRECT (purchases)
**Vibe:** Same luxury aesthetic, but with "Add to Cart"

**What Goes Here:**
- Your books (that YOU wrote)
- Your software/AI tools
- YOUR photography (where YOU are the photographer)
- Prints of YOUR artwork
- Merchandise (if applicable)

**For Sale:** Everything has a price and "Buy Now" button

---

## The Overlap: Luxury Aesthetic

**Both sections share:**
- ✅ Museum-quality presentation
- ✅ Gold accent colors (#D4AF37)
- ✅ Cinematic animations
- ✅ Professional typography
- ✅ Black backgrounds
- ✅ Sophisticated layout

**The difference:**
- **Gallery:** "View" buttons → showcase work
- **Store:** "Add to Cart" buttons → sell products

## AM Reed August 2024 Photos

**Classification:** GALLERY (portfolio)

**Why:**
- AM Reed is the photographer (you're the model)
- Purpose: Show your range as a model
- Goal: Book more modeling work
- Not selling these as prints

**Where They Go:**
- `/gallery/collaborations/am-reed-august-2024`
- OR `/gallery/editorial/am-reed-2024`
- OR `/gallery` (mixed with other shoots)

**How They're Organized:**
- By series: Formal, Underwear, Artistic, Industrial
- Shows versatility to potential clients
- Each series has description of what you can deliver

---

## Instagram Strategy (Portfolio-Focused)

**Purpose:** Build personal brand as model/creative

**Content Mix:**
1. **Portfolio Highlights** (40%) - Best shots from professional shoots
2. **Behind-the-Scenes** (20%) - Working with photographers
3. **Personal Philosophy** (20%) - Renaissance Man content
4. **Product Launches** (20%) - When you release books/software

**AM Reed Photos on Instagram:**
- Show range and professionalism
- Tag AM Reed (cross-promotion)
- Caption: Story about collaboration, creative process
- NOT: "Buy this print" (that's not the goal)
- YES: "Available for bookings" (that IS the goal)

---

## Content Pipeline: Where Things Go

### Photo Shoots (You as Model)
**Destination:** Gallery
**Examples:** AM Reed, future photographer collaborations
**Purpose:** Portfolio, booking work
**Process:** Upload → Organize by series → Instagram showcase → Agencies see → Book work

### Books You Wrote
**Destination:** Store
**Examples:** Book 3 (HTML to PDF)
**Purpose:** Direct sales
**Process:** Convert → Product listing → Instagram launch → Customers buy

### Your Photography (You as Photographer)
**Destination:** Store (if selling) OR Gallery (if portfolio)
**Examples:** TBD - do you have photos where YOU are the photographer?
**Decision:** If selling prints → Store. If showing photography skills → Gallery.

### Poems/Essays
**Destination:** Blog
**Purpose:** Thought leadership, SEO, personal brand
**Process:** Format → Publish → Instagram graphics → Email newsletter

### AI Tools/Software
**Destination:** Store
**Purpose:** Direct sales
**Process:** Package → Product page → Demo video → Launch campaign
